# JellyGallery

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.0.9.
The plan is to create a small online gallery to categorize and show jelly shoes like Melissa, Petit Jolie, Lemon Jelly, among others. After the main gallery is done, I also want to do some kind of CRUD to add new products to the gallery.
I'm using this primordially for learning Angular and improving my frontend skills, as well as learning some backend development. Let's see how it goes. A further step would be allowing other interested people to help expand this gallery. 

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
