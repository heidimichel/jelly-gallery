Schematics (or, what I want to do):
- main component (jelly)
    - top-menu
    - content (where everything will load)
        - home page
        - about page
        - login page
        - search page
            - side menu
            - search results
                - result (a miniature)
                (clicking on the search result leads to the product page)
    - footer
